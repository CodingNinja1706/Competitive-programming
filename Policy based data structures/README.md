# Policy Based Data Structures
--
The g++ compiler also supports some data structures that are not part of the C++ standard library. Such structures are called policy-based data structures. These data structures are designed for high-performance, flexibility, semantic safety, and conformance to the corresponding containers in std.

To use these structures, you must add this code

```c++14
#include <ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp> 
using namespace __gnu_pbds; 
```



>See the usage of these Policy Based Data Structures in the above code file which is showing policy-based data structure that is like set, it can add/remove elements, can find the number of elements less than x, kth smallest element etc in ***O(logn)*** time.
